## UX
### User stories
#### As a **game player** I want to:
1. Enjoy the game
2. Learn something new
3. See my score
#### As a **developer** I want to:
1. Gain more knowledge on JavaScript
2. Learn something on given theme for a game
3. Entertain myself and the end-user by playing the game
### Design Choices
#### Colours
+ **Text** - used #fffde7 (very light yellow) for text on landing page and score section so it can fit well on whole Earth background.
+ **Buttons** - used yellow color for Start Game button on landing page, for the answers buttons #90caf9 (light blue) was used, then the colour was changing on click event in red or green depending if the answer was correct or wrong.
#### Fonts
+ [Balsamiq Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Balsamiq+Sans?query=bal) - used this font for whole website to fit nice through whole experience playing game 
#### Background
+ Earth from Space - to show whole Earth as a place
## Wireframe Mockups:
